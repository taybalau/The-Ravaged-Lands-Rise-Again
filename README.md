# The-Ravaged-Lands-Rise-Again

<h1 Hello guys!/>

<h4 Welcome to the Ravaged Lands Rise Again project! />

<h2 History and proposal: />

<h4 This work was conceived as a project to be delivered in the Software Development course. 
The proposal of this subject is a gamification in the medieval Era where each group represents a fief, 
having knights and a duke (group leader). In my case, I was included in the Black Ravaged Lands group as a knight. />

<h4 Keeping this fact in mind, it was decided by the group to create a website where people would register their activities 
and organize them. And for greater immersion in the context of the class, we decided to gamify the website. />

<h4 The idea of our gamification was to create a medieval village in which each time the user informs that they have completed a task, 
they would receive some object in their village, such as: an animal, a house, a character. So, a village that was once devastated, 
with effort and dedication will rise again! />

<h2 API: />

<h4 This repository contains the project's back-end, which was made by me.
The front I'm creating will be available on GitHub soon,
along with the integration and deployment of both parts. />

<h4 But if you are interested in checking the API locally, here are some instructions: />

<h4 1 - The first step is to configure your database (MySQL) and properties file according to your preferences. The file with the queries is here. />

<h4 2 - After that, download the JSON with the endpoint information and use it wherever you prefer. In my case, I use postman to test my API's. />

<h4 3 - Once all this is done, the API is ready to run. />
