# The-Ravaged-Lands-Rise-Again

Hello guys!

Welcome to the Ravaged Lands Rise Again project!

History and proposal: 

This work was conceived as a project to be delivered in the Software Development course. 
The proposal of this subject is a gamification in the medieval Era where each group represents a fief, 
having knights and a duke (group leader). In my case, I was included in the Black Ravaged Lands group as a knight. 

Keeping this fact in mind, it was decided by the group to create a website where people would register their activities 
and organize them. And for greater immersion in the context of the class, we decided to gamify the website.

The idea of our gamification was to create a medieval village in which each time the user informs that they have completed a task, 
they would receive some object in their village, such as: an animal, a house, a character. So, a village that was once devastated, 
with effort and dedication will rise again!

h2 API:

This repository contains the project's back-end, which was made by me.
The front I'm creating will be available on GitHub soon,
along with the integration and deployment of both parts. 

But if you are interested in checking the API locally, here are some instructions: 

1 - The first step is to configure your database (MySQL) and properties file according to your preferences. The file with the queries is here. 

2 - After that, download the JSON with the endpoint information and use it wherever you prefer. In my case, I use postman to test my API's.

3 - Once all this is done, the API is ready to run.
